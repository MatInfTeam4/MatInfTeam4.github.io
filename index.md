title: Exploring Process Structure Linkages in Machining of Commercial Purity Titanium
---

# background
Machining is a subtractive manufacuting process that removes material via failure due to severe plastic deformation (SPD). The imposed processing conditions contribute to structural changes at small length scales. These structural changes can affect properties relevant to performance at the machined surface.

# experimental

Controlled machining experiments were performed on commercial purity titanium (CP-Ti) through various processing routes. **Include comments on (1) various scales (2) how processing conditions changed (3) what was collected in experiments**

# methods sections

1. segmentation

2. **Methods section "use n-point statistics to explore process-structure linkages" "get a lower order representation using PCA etc.." "estimate the microstructure function _______"**

# Deliverable

1. Generate segmented data set from micrographs
2. Extract pathways in n-point statistic space corresponding to specific processes
