I decided to redesign [chatsecure.org](http://chatsecure.org) with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), a static blogging framework, combined with the very pretty [Incorporated](http://incorporated.sendtoinc.com) theme. If you find any mistakes, or would like to help improve the site, feel free to [submit a pull request](https://github.com/chatsecure/chatsecure.github.io)!

One major issue is that GitHub Pages doesn't support SSL and, even worse, if you have a custom domain it will appear to be completely broken because their servers [don't respond at all](https://chatsecure.org) on port 443 for custom domains.
