Initially a trial image will be utilized to develop edge detection and segmentation methodology. The chip chosen corresponds to the following processing conditions (given in machining parameters). The corresponding estimates of strain and rate are also shown.

| Degree of Deformation |   Deformation Rate      |
| ----------------      | ----------------------- |
| depth of cut =0.1 mm  |      V = 2.33 m/s       |
| strain ~ 0.1-10       |      rate = ~10^5       |

A 5X image and the selected segment are shown below,

A 20X image of the selected segment is shown below,

Images taken at the highest available resolution (100X) are to be used for edge detection and image segmentation. The dropbox location is ![https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ycet38z54770g78/AACLCbNVXNgJnELyGYDhNgGaa?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ycet38z54770g78/AACLCbNVXNgJnELyGYDhNgGaa?dl=0).

Note that the images at 100X requires a multifocus tool to capture all features within the plane. A concern is that artificially generated edges may be difficult to deal with. As such all images are being retained for comparison.
