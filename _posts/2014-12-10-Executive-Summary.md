#Machining Introduction

Machining is a secondary machining operation that typically follows primary shaping processes such as casting or forging. Imposed strains and strain rates can be as large as $$10^5 s^{-1}$$ and 1-15, respectively. During these extreme deformation conditions significant energy is dissipated through plastic work which increases the temperatures in the chip. 

The described strain-rate-temperature conditions define a thermomechanical processing route that is unique to machining. 

Measured shear strain rates  for oxygen-free high-conductivity (OFHC) copper. Note that velocimetry techniques are limited to lower machining speeds; in this case a 0.01 m/s speed was utilized. Industrial applications maching at 3-5 m/s where strain rates may approach $$10^5 s^{-1}$$.
