#Machining Introduction

Machining is a secondary machining operation that typically follows primary shaping processes such as casting or forging. Imposed strains and strain rates can be as large as $$10^5 s^{-1}$$ and 1-15, respectively. During these extreme deformation conditions significant energy is dissipated through plastic work which increases the temperatures in the chip. 

The described strain-rate-temperature conditions define a thermomechanical processing route that is unique to machining. 

Measured shear strain rates  for oxygen-free high-conductivity (OFHC) copper. Note that velocimetry techniques are limited to lower machining speeds; in this case a 0.01 m/s speed was utilized. Industrial applications maching at 3-5 m/s where strain rates may approach $$10^5 s^{-1}$$.

Measured shear strains for this set of experiments fall in the 3-12 range.

#Processing Effects on Microstructure

The imposed thermomechanical processing route can induce significant microstructural changes in both the machined workpiece and the produced chip. Microstructural changes may include but are not limited to,

- Grain refinement
- Increase in dislocation density
- Increase in twin density

#Problem Statement

The manufacturing community has begun to investigate linkages between processing and structure in machining. The motivation is that designers can produce better components if surface structure is tailored for specific applications; highly refined grain structure could be beneficial for fretting applications but deleterious in a corrosive environment.

The goal of the present work is to explore process-structure linkages while quantifying structure gradients present in machined chips.
