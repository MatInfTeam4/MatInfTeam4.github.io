## Chip Morphology and Features of Interest

Below is a cross section of a machined chip. Three regions are highlighted.

Note that this is all a ***single phase***. In other words we cannot define a binary microstructure as we are usually accustomed. The approach now is to capture the location of ***boundaries*** and generate statistics. 

## Image Processing Follow Up

We feel pretty confident with our developed methodology to accurately capture boundary features. Once boundaries are detected the ***boundary thickness is reduced to 1 pixel***. In this way we eliminate any bias that may be introduced from the ***perceived*** boundary thickness.
