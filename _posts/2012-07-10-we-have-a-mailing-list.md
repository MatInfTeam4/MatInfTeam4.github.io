We now have a [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/chatsecure) for public discussion about the app. Feel free to join!

In other news, we are moving ahead with multiple account support and better UI integration with other XMPP services like Facebook, Jabber, Google Apps, and custom servers. Expect v1.3 to be on the App Store in the next few weeks. We are considering dropping AIM support in a future release because the [LibOrange](https://github.com/unixpickle/LibOrange) library seems to be dead. If you still use AIM and would like to see it kept in the app, please make your voice heard!

Also, if have a paid iOS developer account and are looking for longer-running background support, check out the [background](https://github.com/chrisballinger/Off-the-Record-iOS/tree/background) branch on Github.
