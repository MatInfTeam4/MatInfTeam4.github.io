We are excited to announce the release of v2.0 of ChatSecure! There has been a major overhaul of the internals to use Core Data, which will allow us to make major improvements much more quickly in the future. Users have reported some instability with the current release, but it should be fixed in v2.0.1. You can help us track down bugs by opting in to automated crash reporting. You can also submit feedback directly to our [UserVoice](http://chatsecure.uservoice.com/) page, or if you're feeling adventurous submit them directly to our [Github Issues](https://github.com/chrisballinger/Off-the-Record-iOS/issues) tracker.
