In November we added Tibetan translations, better fingerprint verification UI, and added an in-app language switcher. We also introduced a crash-on-launch bug that affected certain locales. This should be fixed in v1.5.1.

* More/updated localizations merged into the app
* Tibetan translation now works
* Improved fingerprint verification user interface
* In-app language switcher for changing to languages not supported by the OS (e.g. Tibetan)
* **v1.5.1** Fix crash on launch bug and localization switcher
