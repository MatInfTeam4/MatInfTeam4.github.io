## Process

Machining processing induces large strains at high-strain rate and elevated temperatures. Idealization is shown below.

There are two experimental controls in such an experiment which both control strain, rate and temperature in a non-unique fashion.

1. Depth of cut
2. Machining surface velocity

## Structure Changes

1. Continuum of grain refinement from micrometer scale down to the nanometer scale
2. Grain elongation at the micrometer scale
3. Increase in dislocation density at the atomistic scale
4. Varying degrees of grain boundary misorientation

## Methods sections

Each metallographic sample may be used to generate ~10 independent micrographs which are assumed to undergo the same processing route. The homogeneous portion of these chips will be used to quantify microstructural features. The analysis will consist of:

1. Segmentation of micrographs - Processing images to identify phase boundaries (twins or grain boundaries). 

2. Quantification of relevant statistics - Use n-point statistics to explore process-structure linkages and quantify the relevant microstructure function(s). This will also include reducing the order of the statistics possibly through principal component analysis (PCA).

## Deliverables

1. Generate segmented data set from micrographs
2. Extract pathways in n-point statistic space corresponding to specific processes
