At this point in the semester, we need to start obtaining some results, even if we know that they are not near the best ones we can obtain. We have 2 segmentation methods based on thresholding and edge detection that show decent accuracy in identifying the boundaries. The following schedule will be adopted for the rest of the term:

While exploring ways to improve segmentation in the background:

**1)** Obtain optical images of the chips resulting from the use of the following tool parameters.

|               | V = 0.33 m/s | V = 1.00 m/s | V = 1.67 m/s | V = 2.33 m/s | V = 3.00 m/s |
| ------------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| t=0.1 mm      |      x       |              |              |              |       x      |
| t=0.2 mm      |              |              |              |              |              |
| t=0.3 mm      |              |              |              |              |       x      |


**2)** For each case, obtain images at 3 approximate areas from 10 chips. Namely (as shown in the previous post):
	- Left Shear Zone
	- Right Shear Zone
	- Middle Region

**3)** Create 2 separate data sets using each segmentation method.

**4)** Divide shear zones into subsections based on their distance from the edges as necessary. This will be resorted to as often as the analysis at later stages warrants it.

**5)** Calculate 2 Point Statistics on each of the data sets.

**6)** Cast the data sets to the principal component space.

**7)** Try to identify patterns correlations in the PC space that correspond to process parameters and the distance from the edges of the individual chips.
