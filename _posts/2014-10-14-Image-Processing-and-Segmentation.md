## Image Processing

Current challenge is to develop an algorithm to capture microstructural features (grain boundaries) in an automated and accurate fashion. 

Previous updated included attempts as using thresholding and edge detection methods in Matlab to characterize images.

Preliminary results were poor. The initial concern was that large shadows in the image could generate false-detections. However gradient calculations seemed to eliminate shadow effects at the large length scale.
