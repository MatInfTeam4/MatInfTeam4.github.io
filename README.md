# A Modified Version of Jekyll Incorporated
**Orginal Description:** Modern Jekyll based blog. Great for companies, products or anything. See live at [blog.sendtoinc.com](http://blog.sendtoinc.com)

**Modified Version:** Modified for use as the base domain of an organization repository. A template for team projects. 

# Installation
just fork this repository and either rename it to your GitHub Pages domain name (username.github.io) or rename it to anything and create a gh-pages branch. If you go with the second option you will have to modify the permalinks at *tabname*.md files as /reponame/tabname/.

Modify _config.yaml appropriately. If you don't understand what it is, you probably don't have to change it. Change images and post front matter to get a functioning blog.
